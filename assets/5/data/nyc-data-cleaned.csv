Missing Cop. - w4m (Midtown West),Missing Cop. , w4m (Midtown West),,,,w4m ,"It's been more than a month since I met a cop. We've been together for just a night. But I'm still thinking of him. I tried not to, but I couldn't resist his memory in me. He brought out a piece of me, I never thought existed. After that night, I felt something was different. *** It was almost 2AM when I got into The Mean Fiddler. That was my last day in New York. I'm a humanitarian worker and human rights activist. Just like others, I'd rather watch late night news, than go clubbing. But that day was different. I wanted to experience New York's nightlife. I gave it to myself because tomorrow, I would be in India and things would be different. So I thought, that was my final chance. I didn't want to miss it. I was on the dance floor, when I met him. His friend introduced me to him. He said they were celebrating his retirement. He approached me. He was wearing a big smile and his eyes were gleaming. He was so inviting. How could I resist. We danced. I couldn't stop staring at him, while he moved his body towards me. I was so mesmerized. I never believe in love at first sight, but that was different. I felt something very special about him. It was so intense and it was making me tremble. So, I just asked his name. He said, ""I'm Kevin."" I asked what he does. ""I'm a cop."" My fantasy was doomed. Everybody has prejudices, and I am not an exception. I experienced being beaten by cops in my country. I remember an instance after a human rights protest. I was looking for my flip-flops that I lost during the dispersal, and a cop grabbed me and hit me. It was a painful experience. After that moment, every time I see a cop, I feel fear and hatred. Now, I'm dancing with him. It was really uncomfortable. I was so attracted to him, but it felt not right. He is a cop. I'm an activist. Why are we dancing?! I wanted to walk away, call it a day and just go back to my hotel room. But in a very soft voice, he asked, ""Are you okay?"" I could feel his concern. I was so confused. I couldn't reconcile my prejudices and the man in front of me. I wanted to leave, but there was something that pulls me to him. I couldn't leave him. The feeling was so intense and extraordinary. I didn't want to miss it. So, we continued dancing. I danced like it's the last dance of my life. We were like flowing water dancing with fire. It was so soothing, but fiery. Then he kissed me. It was so daring. I never had been kissed that way before. It was so wonderful and ecstatic. He kissed away all the fears and hatred, I had felt. It was so bold. I couldn't resist not wanting more. But, The Mean Fiddler was about to close. I thought I don't this to be over yet. I don't want to miss the chance of being with him. So, I asked him if he wants to come with me. He did. We went to my hotel room, and continued dancing. But this time, we danced our desires. I was drunk, but I can remember every detail of our one night romance. It was so different. I was never touched, the way he touched me. I was never caressed, the way he did. I felt a special connection with him. I felt more than lust. Then, we reached the peak of our impulses. I let it go and surrendered. Everything was overflowing. It was so cold and soothing. Then, I woke up. I was lying beside him. I felt the tranquility I was yearning to feel. I felt so secure and calm. I never felt what way before. I always woke up anxious and vulnerable. But this time, it was bliss. I was really touched by his presence. I kept on staring at him while he sleeps -- his cute pointed nose and thin lips, his broad shoulders, his tattoo all over his arms. . .Everything is perfect about him. But unfortunately, everything is not perfect about us. I'm a humanitarian worker and activist from the global south. New York is only for short engagement, because the United Nations is there. But it's not the space I wanted to be. While, he belongs to New York and he is making the city a safe place to live in. I was afraid our romance is not feasible. I was afraid if I will push it through, one of us had to leave the people whom we are serving. We both belong to where the people need us most. So, I stood up and started packing my things. My flight was in the next couple of hours. Then, he woke up. It was already 8:45AM. He had an appointment and needed to leave. He gets dressed and about to go. I hugged him so tight. I know this might be the last time that I could hug him. I never wanted to let go. But I needed to. Then, he asked if I want to go out and dance with him again. I said, ""I'm leaving."" He left. That was the end of it. I continued packing my things, and then went to the airport. I was so sober and confused. I like him so much, but I was so afraid. I wanted to hold his hands, but I was trembling. Then, when I was about to board the plane going to Abu Dhabi, I felt something was wrong. I felt, I did the wrong thing. But it was too late. I missed the opportunity to keep someone who is so precious. Then, I arrived at my destination. It was midnight in Mumbai. The first thing I did upon getting into my hotel room was to search for his name online. But I couldn't remember his last name. It might be, Bradley, Bodley, Codley, Moloney, Langley, or whatever. All I remember was it ended with ""-y"" or maybe not. I was so hopeless. I felt it's over, and there's nothing that I could do anymore. So, days passed. I was in the middle of a meeting, when something popped into my mind. ""Oh! Kevin is with the NYPD!"" Four letters can save me. So, I searched on the NYPD's website, Twitter and Facebook page. He might have a picture or full name there. I was so hopeful. But then, there were none. I couldn't find him. I was so frustrated. I was losing hope. I know I needed to stop my fondness for him. I thought, maybe when I go back to my country, things will be different. I might be missing home. So I did. But then, I failed. Right after I arrived, I was lying down on my bed and about to close my eyes, when I felt something was missing. It's him again. There's no point in denying. I left a part of my heart in New York. So, everyday, I take a look at the NYPD's page, hoping to see him -- the photos of the Saint Patrick's Day parade, the posts about the retirees, the activities, the troopers. . . I know there are thousands of police officers in New York and the probability of seeing him is almost negative. But, I want to try. I'm still hoping that one day, I will be able to see him. If not, I just want him to know, in the midst of all uncertainties, one thing I'm confident is certain: He stayed with me. The Mean Fiddler. The dance. The kiss. The romance. They will be in my heart, wherever I go. His memories will be with me; in the different countries I set foot on, and in the different continents I cross. Because he wasn't just a cop. He wasn't just a man in uniform. He's the man who brought out a piece of me, I never thought existed. He is the man whom I like so much. And I want him to know, that someone is thinking of him.

Right after I arrived,
I was lying down on my bed
and about to close my eyes,
when I felt something was missing.
It's him again.
There's no point in denying.
I left a part of my heart in New York.

The Mean Fiddler.
The dance.
The kiss.
The romance.
They will be in my heart,
wherever I go.
His memories will be with me; in the different countries I set foot on,
and in the different continents I cross.
Because he wasn't just a cop.
He wasn't just a man in uniform.
He's the man who brought out a piece of me,

He is the man whom I like so much.
And I want him to know,

I let it go and surrendered. Everything was overflowing. It was so cold and soothing. Then, I woke up. I was lying beside him. I felt the tranquility I was yearning to feel. I felt so secure and calm. I never felt what way before. I always woke up anxious and vulnerable. But this time, it was bliss. I was really touched by his presence. I kept on staring at him while he sleeps -- his cute pointed nose and thin lips, his broad shoulders, his tattoo all over his arms. . .Everything is perfect about him. But unfortunately, everything is not perfect about us. I'm a humanitarian worker and activist from the global south. New York is only for short engagement, because the United Nations is there. But it's not the space I wanted to be. While, he belongs to New York and he is making the city a safe place to live in. I was afraid our romance is not feasible. I was afraid if I will push it through, one of us had to leave the people whom we are serving. We both belong to where the people need us most. So, I stood up and started packing my things. My flight was in the next couple of hours. Then, he woke up. It was already 8:45AM. He had an appointment and needed to leave. He gets dressed and about to go. I hugged him so tight. I know this might be the last time that I could hug him. I never wanted to let go. But I needed to. Then, he asked if I want to go out and dance with him again. I said, ""I'm leaving."" He left. That was the end of it. I continued packing my things, and then went to the airport. I was so sober and confused. I like him so much, but I was so afraid. I wanted to hold his hands, but I was trembling. Then, when I was about to board the plane going to Abu Dhabi, I felt something was wrong. I felt, I did the wrong thing. But it was too late. I missed the opportunity to keep someone who is so precious. Then, I arrived at my destination. It was midnight in Mumbai. The first thing I did upon getting into my hotel room was to search for his name online. But I couldn't remember his last name. It might be, Bradley, Bodley, Codley, Moloney, Langley, or whatever. All I remember was it ended with ""-y"" or maybe not. I was so hopeless. I felt it's over, and there's nothing that I could do anymore. So, days passed. I was in the middle of a meeting, when something popped into my mind. ""Oh! Kevin is with the NYPD!"" Four letters can save me. So, I searched on the NYPD's website, Twitter and Facebook page. He might have a picture or full name there. I was so hopeful. But then, there were none. I couldn't find him. I was so frustrated. I was losing hope. I know I needed to stop my fondness for him. I thought, maybe when I go back to my country, things will be different. I might be missing home. So I did. But then, I failed. Right after I arrived, I was lying down on my bed and about to close my eyes, when I felt something was missing. It's him again. There's no point in denying. I left a part of my heart in New York. So, everyday, I take a look at the NYPD's page, hoping to see him -- the photos of the Saint Patrick's Day parade, the posts about the retirees, the activities, the troopers. . . I know there are thousands of police officers in New York and the probability of seeing him is almost negative. But, I want to try. I'm still hoping that one day, I will be able to see him. If not, I just want him to know, in the midst of all uncertainties, one thing I'm confident is certain: He stayed with me. The Mean Fiddler. The dance. The kiss. The romance. They will be in my heart, wherever I go. His memories will be with me; in the different countries I set foot on, and in the different continents I cross. Because he wasn't just a cop. He wasn't just a man in uniform. He's the man who brought out a piece of me, I never thought existed. He is the man whom I like so much. And I want him to know, that someone is thinking of him. Someone is hoping that he is safe, while protecting the people of New York. I badly want him to be safe. And, though we live on the opposite sides of the world, but we share the same passion and love for the people. Though his night is my day, but we're under the same sun and breathing the same air. And someday, we might meet again, or maybe not anymore. But, I'm just here waiting on the dance floor, for him to dance with me. ###","It's been more than a month since I met a cop.
We've been together for just a night.
But I'm still thinking of him.
I tried not to,
but I couldn't resist his memory in me.
He brought out a piece of me,
I never thought existed.
After that night,
I felt something was different.
*** It was almost 2AM when I got into The Mean Fiddler.
That was my last day in New York.
I'm a humanitarian worker
and human rights activist.
Just like others,
I'd rather watch late night news,
than go clubbing.
But that day was different.
I wanted to experience New York's nightlife.
I gave it to myself because tomorrow,
I would be in India
and things would be different.
So I thought,
that was my final chance.
I didn't want to miss it.
I was on the dance floor,
when I met him.
His friend introduced me to him.
He said they were celebrating his retirement.
He approached me.
He was wearing a big smile
and his eyes were gleaming.
He was so inviting.
How could I resist.
We danced.
I couldn't stop staring at him,
while he moved his body towards me.
I was so mesmerized.
I never believe in love at first sight,
but that was different.
I felt something very special about him.
It was so intense
and it was making me tremble.
So,
I just asked his name.
He said,
""I'm Kevin."" I asked what he does.
""I'm a cop."" My fantasy was doomed.
Everybody has prejudices,
and I am not an exception.
I experienced being beaten by cops in my country.
I remember an instance after a human rights protest.
I was looking for my flip-flops that I lost during the dispersal,
and a cop grabbed me
and hit me.
It was a painful experience.
After that moment,
every time I see a cop,
I feel fear
and hatred.
Now,
I'm dancing with him.
It was really uncomfortable.
I was so attracted to him,
but it felt not right.
He is a cop.
I'm an activist.
Why are we dancing?! I wanted to walk away,
call it a day
and just go back to my hotel room.
But in a very soft voice,
he asked,
""Are you okay?"" I could feel his concern.
I was so confused.
I couldn't reconcile my prejudices
and the man in front of me.
I wanted to leave,
but there was something that pulls me to him.
I couldn't leave him.
The feeling was so intense
and extraordinary.
I didn't want to miss it.
So,
we continued dancing.
I danced like it's the last dance of my life.
We were like flowing water dancing with fire.
It was so soothing,
but fiery.
Then he kissed me.
It was so daring.
I never had been kissed that way before.
It was so wonderful
and ecstatic.
He kissed away all the fears
and hatred,
I had felt.
It was so bold.
I couldn't resist not wanting more.
But,
The Mean Fiddler was about to close.
I thought I don't this to be over yet.
I don't want to miss the chance of being with him.
So,
I asked him if he wants to come with me.
He did.
We went to my hotel room,
and continued dancing.
But this time,
we danced our desires.
I was drunk,
but I can remember every detail of our one night romance.
It was so different.
I was never touched,
the way he touched me.
I was never caressed,
the way he did.
I felt a special connection with him.
I felt more than lust.
Then,
we reached the peak of our impulses.
I let it go
and surrendered.
Everything was overflowing.
It was so cold
and soothing.
Then,
I woke up.
I was lying beside him.
I felt the tranquility I was yearning to feel.
I felt so secure
and calm.
I never felt what way before.
I always woke up anxious
and vulnerable.
But this time,
it was bliss.
I was really touched by his presence.
I kept on staring at him while he sleeps -- his cute pointed nose
and thin lips,
his broad shoulders,
his tattoo all over his arms.
.
.Everything is perfect about him.
But unfortunately,
everything is not perfect about us.
I'm a humanitarian worker
and activist from the global south.
New York is only for short engagement,
because the United Nations is there.
But it's not the space I wanted to be.
While,
he belongs to New York
and he is making the city a safe place to live in.
I was afraid our romance is not feasible.
I was afraid if I will push it through,
one of us had to leave the people whom we are serving.
We both belong to where the people need us most.
So,
I stood up
and started packing my things.
My flight was in the next couple of hours.
Then,
he woke up.
It was already 8:45AM.
He had an appointment
and needed to leave.
He gets dressed
and about to go.
I hugged him so tight.
I know this might be the last time that I could hug him.
I never wanted to let go.
But I needed to.
Then,
he asked if I want to go out
and dance with him again.
I said,
""I'm leaving."" He left.
That was the end of it.
I continued packing my things,
and then went to the airport.
I was so sober
and confused.
I like him so much,
but I was so afraid.
I wanted to hold his hands,
but I was trembling.
Then,
when I was about to board the plane going to Abu Dhabi,
I felt something was wrong.
I felt,
I did the wrong thing.
But it was too late.
I missed the opportunity to keep someone who is so precious.
Then,
I arrived at my destination.
It was midnight in Mumbai.
The first thing I did upon getting into my hotel room was to search for his name online.
But I couldn't remember his last name.
It might be,
Bradley,
Bodley,
Codley,
Moloney,
Langley,
or whatever.
All I remember was it ended with ""-y"" or maybe not.
I was so hopeless.
I felt it's over,
and there's nothing that I could do anymore.
So,
days passed.
I was in the middle of a meeting,
when something popped into my mind.
""Oh! Kevin is with the NYPD!"" Four letters can save me.
So,
I searched on the NYPD's website,
Twitter
and Facebook page.
He might have a picture or full name there.
I was so hopeful.
But then,
there were none.
I couldn't find him.
I was so frustrated.
I was losing hope.
I know I needed to stop my fondness for him.
I thought,
maybe when I go back to my country,
things will be different.
I might be missing home.
So I did.
But then,
I failed.
Right after I arrived,
I was lying down on my bed
and about to close my eyes,
when I felt something was missing.
It's him again.
There's no point in denying.
I left a part of my heart in New York.
So,
everyday,
I take a look at the NYPD's page,
hoping to see him -- the photos of the Saint Patrick's Day parade,
the posts about the retirees,
the activities,
the troopers.
.
.
I know there are thousands of police officers in New York
and the probability of seeing him is almost negative.
But,
I want to try.
I'm still hoping that one day,
I will be able to see him.
If not,
I just want him to know,
in the midst of all uncertainties,
one thing I'm confident is certain: He stayed with me.
The Mean Fiddler.
The dance.
The kiss.
The romance.
They will be in my heart,
wherever I go.
His memories will be with me; in the different countries I set foot on,
and in the different continents I cross.
Because he wasn't just a cop.
He wasn't just a man in uniform.
He's the man who brought out a piece of me,

He is the man whom I like so much.
And I want him to know,
that someone is thinking of him.
Someone is hoping that he is safe,
while protecting the people of New York.
I badly want him to be safe.
And,
though we live on the opposite sides of the world,
but we share the same passion
and love for the people.
Though his night is my day,
but we're under the same sun
and breathing the same air.
And someday,

or maybe not anymore.
But,

Dr. Patrick Carnes Sexual addiction is defined as any sexually-related compulsive behavior which interferes with normal living and causes severe stress on family, friends, loved ones, and one's work environment. Like an alcoholic unable to stop drinking, sexual addicts are unable to stop their self-destructive sexual behavior. This aggression may display itself in a multitude of negative ways, even abuse toward others.

Most grapple with other addictions in addition to sex addiction, but often find overcoming sexual addiction the most difficult. Much hope nevertheless exists for these addicts and their families.

Dr. Patrick Carnes in his book, Contrary to Love: Helping the Sexual Addict states, ""Contrary to enjoying sex as a self-affirming source of physical pleasure, the sex addict has learned to rely on sex for comfort from pain, nurturing, or relief from stress, etc., the way an alcoholic relies on alcohol, or a drug addict on drugs.""
